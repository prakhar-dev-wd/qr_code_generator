# qr_code_generator
This will generate a QR code for a website.
I have used 2 Node package Module(npm)
1-> inquirer about getting the website name
2-> qr-image for generating the image of the website.

In this, all the history of websites for which QR is generated is saved in a text file named "URL.txt".
